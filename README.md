## Project Overview

**Title:** Bytes Touch Log: A Web-based Fingerprint Biometric Application as an Attendance Recorder System in Events for the CICS Bytes Office

**Front End:** Vue.js via JavaScript  
**Back End:** Express.js via Javascript  
**Database:** Sequelize/MongoDB

---

## Description

A fingerprint-based attendance system is a sophisticated biometric technology that utilizes the distinctive patterns and ridges present in an individual's fingerprints to uniquely identify and record their presence or absence at a specific location or event (Muhammad Sarfaz, 2021).

This project is a desktop application with a web-based interface that uses a biometric device to record student attendance in a database. It serves as a digital signature for logging in and out during events, aiming to improve the attendance recording process by eliminating the manual system. This application will be used in the Bytes Office by the Bytes officers, enhancing the performance and efficiency of the attendance system.

## Features

- **Biometric Authentication:** Utilizes fingerprint recognition for secure and accurate attendance recording.
- **Real-time Attendance Tracking:** Provides instant updates and logs for student attendance.
- **Event Management:** Supports attendance tracking for multiple events and sessions.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Intuitive design for easy navigation and usage.
- **Data Security:** Ensures the security and privacy of user data with robust database management.
